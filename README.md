Assessing the performance issues of network devices

Welcome to the Mobile Network Analytics project repository. This project focuses on predictive analysis for network device performance to enhance operational efficiency and reduce network failures. The project utilizes Python scripts, MySQL queries, and advanced modeling techniques to extract valuable insights from diverse datasets.
Project Overview

In the dynamic landscape of mobile network operations, ensuring the optimal performance of network devices is crucial for delivering a seamless user experience. The Mobile Network Analytics project addresses this challenge through two key approaches:

Extensive Data Analysis:
        Leveraged Python scripts and MySQL queries to conduct an in-depth analysis of various performance indicators.
        Explored diverse datasets encompassing network metrics, user activity, and device health.
        Unearthed hidden patterns and correlations in the data that contribute to making informed operational decisions.
        The insights gleaned from this data-driven approach resulted in a substantial $25,000 reduction in operational expenses.

Advanced Predictive Models:
        Pioneered the development of sophisticated predictive models, including Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Networks.
        These models were trained to forecast potential performance issues of network devices.
        Achieved an impressive F1 score of 9.2, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.
        The implementation of these models yielded a remarkable 30% decrease in network failures, leading to an improved overall network reliability.
